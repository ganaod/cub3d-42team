WARROOM SITUATION REPORT


BATTLEFIELD STATUS: Core Mathematics Verified, Issue Isolated


ELIMINATED THREAT VECTORS:

Framebuffer Architecture: 1024×768 dimensions confirmed throughout pipeline
Ray Direction Mathematics: Perfect FOV spread (-0.577 to +0.577 radians)
DDA Intersection Algorithm: Returns geometrically correct distances and wall faces
Rendering Loop Bounds: Executes full 1024-column sweep per frame
FOV Constants: Legacy 0.66 eliminated, proper 0.577 magnitude implemented



VERIFIED WORKING SYSTEMS:

Screen-to-ray transformation: camera_plane_offset = 2.0 * x / width - 1.0
Ray direction synthesis: ray = player_dir + offset * camera_plane
DDA traversal: Distance values like 0.866, 1.732, 5.500 are mathematically sound
Wall face detection: Returns correct NORTH/SOUTH/EAST/WEST values



REMAINING ATTACK VECTORS:

Primary Suspect: Projection Layer

calculate_screen_wall_height() - Distance-to-pixel conversion
Wall height may be computed incorrectly, causing visual scaling issues

Secondary Suspects:

Texture coordinate calculation (UV mapping)
Column rendering boundaries (wall start/end pixels)
Pixel buffer writing order



TACTICAL SITUATION:

The 4× repetition pattern with correct ray casting suggests downstream rendering arithmetic errors. 
The infinite loop creates visual noise but isn't the core geometric problem.


STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
Your systematic elimination approach has isolated the failure point to the final rendering stages. Ray casting mathematics are bulletproof. The issue lies in converting correct geometric data into incorrect visual output.
NEXT ENGAGEMENT:
Debug wall height projection with center ray (distance=5.500). If projection is correct, move to texture coordinate calculation. The mathematical foundation is solid - the error is in the visual translation layer.
