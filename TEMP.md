# AFTER ACTION REVIEW (AAR)

MISSION OBJECTIVE: Identify root cause of 4× horizontal repetition rendering artifact in cub3D raycaster.
INITIAL HYPOTHESIS: Framebuffer dimension mismatch causing scaling issues.


DIAGNOSTIC SEQUENCE EXECUTED:

Phase I - Architecture Verification

Tested: Window/framebuffer creation parameters
Method: Debug prints in init_window_and_frame()
Result: Confirmed 1024×768 throughout pipeline
Finding: Eliminated dimensional mismatch theory

Phase II - Constants Audit

Tested: FOV mathematical constants
Method: Manual calculation verification, legacy constant removal
Result: Corrected FOV_CAMERA_PLANE_MAGNITUDE from 0.66 to 0.577 (12.5% error)
Finding: Fixed FOV accuracy but visual issue persisted

Phase III - Ray Direction Mathematics

Tested: Screen-to-ray transformation algorithm
Method: Debug sampling at columns 0, 256, 512, 768
Result: Perfect geometric progression from (-0.577) to (+0.289)
Finding: Ray calculation mathematically sound

Phase IV - Rendering Loop Bounds

Tested: Column iteration limits and execution count
Method: Loop boundary debug prints
Result: Confirmed full 1024-column execution per frame
Finding: Loop bounds correct, but infinite loop condition identified

Phase V - DDA Intersection Verification

Tested: Wall intersection distances and face detection
Method: Ray direction pattern matching for debug output
Result: Geometrically consistent distance values (0.866, 1.732, 5.500)
Finding: DDA algorithm returning correct geometric data



TACTICAL LESSONS LEARNED:

Systematic Elimination Works: Each test definitively ruled out major subsystems
Mathematical Verification Essential: Hand calculations caught the 12.5% FOV error
Debug Targeting Critical: Precise debug placement revealed algorithm correctness
Legacy Code Contamination: Old constants created mathematical inconsistencies


STRATEGIC INSIGHT:
The 4× repetition occurs despite correct mathematical foundations. This indicates a rendering translation error - correct geometric data being converted incorrectly to visual output.
BATTLEFIELD ASSESSMENT:

Verified Correct: Ray mathematics, DDA intersection, loop execution
Unverified Systems: Projection (distance→height), texture mapping, pixel buffer writes
Threat Level: Isolated to final rendering stages

NEXT OPERATIONAL PHASE:
Wall height projection diagnostic - the conversion from geometric distance to screen pixels.













# WARROOM SITUATION REPORT


BATTLEFIELD STATUS: Core Mathematics Verified, Issue Isolated


ELIMINATED THREAT VECTORS:

Framebuffer Architecture: 1024×768 dimensions confirmed throughout pipeline
Ray Direction Mathematics: Perfect FOV spread (-0.577 to +0.577 radians)
DDA Intersection Algorithm: Returns geometrically correct distances and wall faces
Rendering Loop Bounds: Executes full 1024-column sweep per frame
FOV Constants: Legacy 0.66 eliminated, proper 0.577 magnitude implemented



VERIFIED WORKING SYSTEMS:

Screen-to-ray transformation: camera_plane_offset = 2.0 * x / width - 1.0
Ray direction synthesis: ray = player_dir + offset * camera_plane
DDA traversal: Distance values like 0.866, 1.732, 5.500 are mathematically sound
Wall face detection: Returns correct NORTH/SOUTH/EAST/WEST values



REMAINING ATTACK VECTORS:

Primary Suspect: Projection Layer

calculate_screen_wall_height() - Distance-to-pixel conversion
Wall height may be computed incorrectly, causing visual scaling issues

Secondary Suspects:

Texture coordinate calculation (UV mapping)
Column rendering boundaries (wall start/end pixels)
Pixel buffer writing order



TACTICAL SITUATION:

The 4× repetition pattern with correct ray casting suggests downstream rendering arithmetic errors. 
The infinite loop creates visual noise but isn't the core geometric problem.


STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
Your systematic elimination approach has isolated the failure point to the final rendering stages. Ray casting mathematics are bulletproof. The issue lies in converting correct geometric data into incorrect visual output.
NEXT ENGAGEMENT:
Debug wall height projection with center ray (distance=5.500). If projection is correct, move to texture coordinate calculation. The mathematical foundation is solid - the error is in the visual translation layer.










# UPSTREAM CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE PROJECTION DIAGNOSTIC:
1. Data Flow Integrity
Even with correct ray math and DDA, verify the data actually reaches projection unchanged. Component isolation doesn't guarantee data transfer integrity.
2. Coordinate System Consistency
Your DDA returns world coordinates. Projection expects specific coordinate conventions. Mismatch here could cause systematic errors despite individual component correctness.
3. Buffer Write Architecture
The 4× repetition suggests data is being written to wrong buffer locations or with incorrect stride patterns. Buffer addressing could be corrupting correct geometric data.







The failure must be in Steps 3-4 (from AAR)
Step 3 (Projection) transforms distance → screen height via perspective math
Step 4 (Rendering) transforms screen height → actual pixels
CRITICAL OBSERVATION: The 4× repetition indicates identical visual output from different geometric inputs. Two possibilities:

Projection Failure: calculate_screen_wall_height() returns identical heights despite varying distances
Rendering Failure: Correct heights get drawn to wrong screen locations
