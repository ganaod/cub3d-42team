# testing protocol
## based off of subject

### COMPILATION & EXECUTABLE
[x]`make` compiles without errors or warnings
[x]`make` does not relink when run twice consecutively  
[x]Executable named exactly `cub3D` (case sensitive)
[x]`make clean` removes object files
[x]`make fclean` removes executable and objects
[x]`make re` performs clean rebuild

### CONFIGURATION FILE PARSING - BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
[x]Program accepts `.cub` file as single argument
[x]All texture paths (NO, SO, WE, EA) parse correctly
[x]Floor color (F R,G,B) parses correctly with values 0-255
[x]Ceiling color (C R,G,B) parses correctly with values 0-255
[x]Map parsing works with valid rectangular maps
[x]Player spawn position (N,S,E,W) detected and oriented correctly

### CONFIGURATION FILE PARSING - ERROR HANDLING
[]Non-`.cub` extension rejected with error message
[]Missing texture paths cause proper error exit
[]Invalid texture paths (non-existent files) cause error exit
[]Duplicate entries (e.g., two NO lines) cause error exit
[]Invalid RGB values (>255, negative, non-numeric) cause error exit
[]Missing map section causes error exit
[]Map with no player spawn causes error exit
[]Map with multiple players causes error exit
[]Open/unclosed map causes error exit
[]Invalid map characters cause error exit

### CONFIGURATION FILE PARSING
[x]Empty lines between sections handled correctly
[]Extra whitespace in texture paths handled
[]Extra whitespace in color definitions handled  
[]Comments (if supported) or random text cause appropriate response
[]Very large maps (1000x1000) handle gracefully or error appropriately
[]Malformed RGB (missing commas, extra values) properly rejected

### WINDOW & DISPLAY BASICS
[]Window opens immediately on program launch
[]Window displays maze interior view (not black/white screen)
[]Window title shows appropriate name
[]Window can be moved around desktop
[]Window can be minimized and restored without corruption
[]Window can be partially covered and uncovered without corruption
[]Alt-tab switching preserves window content

### INPUT HANDLING - BASIC EVENTS
[]ESC key closes window and exits cleanly
[]Red X button closes window and exits cleanly
[]Program exits with return code 0 on clean shutdown
[]No zombie processes left after program exit

### MOVEMENT SYSTEM - BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
[]W key moves forward (view changes appropriately)
[]S key moves backward (view changes appropriately)  
[]A key strafes left (sideways movement, not rotation)
[]D key strafes right (sideways movement, not rotation)
[]Left arrow rotates view left (no position change)
[]Right arrow rotates view right (no position change)
[]Movement is smooth and responsive (>15 FPS subjective)

### MOVEMENT SYSTEM - SPAWN ORIENTATION
[]Player with 'N' in map faces North (toward top of map)
[]Player with 'S' in map faces South (toward bottom of map)
[]Player with 'E' in map faces East (toward right of map)
[]Player with 'W' in map faces West (toward left of map)

### WALL RENDERING - TEXTURE SYSTEM
[]North-facing walls show NO texture consistently
[]South-facing walls show SO texture consistently
[]East-facing walls show EA texture consistently
[]West-facing walls show WE texture consistently
[]Changing texture path in .cub file changes rendered texture
[]Different wall faces show visually distinct textures
[]Textures appear correctly scaled and positioned

### WALL RENDERING - COLORS
[]Floor displays specified F color correctly
[]Ceiling displays specified C color correctly
[]Changing floor color in .cub file updates display
[]Changing ceiling color in .cub file updates display

### COLLISION DETECTION
[]Player cannot walk through walls (1 characters)
[]Player can walk through empty spaces (0 characters)
[]Player cannot exit map boundaries
[]Collision feels responsive and accurate

### PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
[]Program runs at consistent framerate during movement
[]No visible stuttering or frame drops during normal operation
[]Memory usage remains stable (no obvious leaks during gameplay)
[]Program handles rapid input without crashing

### SMART-ASS STRESS TESTS
[]Keyboard mashing (roll face on keyboard) doesn't crash program
[]Rapid window resizing/minimizing doesn't break display
[]Running with wrong number of arguments fails gracefully
[]Random command line arguments don't cause crashes
[]Extremely rapid movement input handled correctly
[]Standing very close to walls renders without artifacts
[]Looking directly at wall corners renders correctly

### MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS
[x]Perspective looks realistic (distant objects smaller)
[]Wall heights appear consistent when walking parallel to them
[x]No fisheye distortion visible
[x]No obvious visual glitches or artifacts

### VISUAL VERIFICATION TESTS
[]Load provided test map and verify maze interior visible
[x]Walk through entire playable area without crashes
[x]Verify all 4 wall texture types are actually different and visible
[]Check floor and ceiling colors are clearly visible and correct
[]Rotation produces smooth, realistic view changes

### EDGE CASE VERIFICATION
[]Program handles maps with irregular shapes (not just rectangles)
[]Maps with single-cell-wide passages work correctly
[]Player spawning near walls works without issues
[]Very small maps (3x3) work correctly
[]Maps with maximum complexity work without performance issues

### FINAL VERIFICATION
[x]No compilation warnings with -Wall -Wextra -Werror
[]No memory leaks detected with valgrind or similar
[]Program executable is reasonably sized (not bloated)
[]All required files present and correctly named
[]Makefile follows 42 standards (correct rules, no relinking)

### EVALUATION SIMULATION
[]Run through complete evaluation protocol with test partner
[]Verify all tests pass consistently (not just once)
[]Document any edge cases or unusual behavior
[]Confirm program meets all mandatory requirements exactly
