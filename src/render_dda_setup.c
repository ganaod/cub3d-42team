/* dda setup: transform ray dir > grid traversal params

purpose:
. convert continous ray dir to discrete stepping params
. pre-calculate distances to avoid runtime computation
. determine initial boundary distances for efficient traversal

insight:
grid spacing is uniform & ray's angle stays const:
calculate step distances once,
reuse throughout traversal.
this is the optimisation that makes dda superior
to naive ray stepping approaches
this delta_dist is a fixed constant for the entire ray's journey */
